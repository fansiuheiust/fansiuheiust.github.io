            In my Secondary School, I had hands-on experiences with artificial intelligence.
            In 2022, I participated in Formula AI, a racing competition with Donkey Car - a self-driving remote-control car, and won second place.
            Donkey Car is trained by recording frames using its front camera, and processing them from a server in Google Colab.
            Through this competition, I learnt the factors affecting the accuracy of an AI model, such as number and quality of data, environmental lighting.
            <br>
            In the next year, I attended an AI drone course, which used drones from DJI with front cameras, capable of image recognition.
            From this course, I learnt to incorporate predictions from AI into programs, like making the drones fly up upon seeing a character.
            <br>
            <br>
            Aside from AI, I also gained valuable experience in game software engineering.
            For the school's Open Day, I made a game inspired by Hypixel Skyblock's dungeon-crawler in Unity.
            The game includes procedural generation, mobs, puzzles, ... (see: <a href="#project">Projects</a>).

            Upon entering HKUST, I quickly realized that to secure a major in Computer Science, 
            I needed to earn sufficient grade points. Therefore, I studied harder in my first semester to realize my dream major.
            Obtaining my first Dean's List award, I found my strength in the academic field. Despite having enough grade points, 
            I continued persuing for better grades to "exceed 4" in my first year, as it happened.
            <br>
            Now that I have achieved my academic goal, I am looking for a more vibrant university life in subsequent years, by enlarging my social circle, joining 
            student-held organizations, and so on.

                This game is inspired by Hypixel Skyblock's dungeons (Catacombs), made for my secondary school's open day.
                <br>
                In this game, the dungeon is procedurally generated in a square grid filled with rooms.
                The rooms include: combat room, puzzle room, blacksmith room, mini-boss room, and a pre-boss room.
                <br>
                Spawned in a starting room, the player will explore the dungeon to fight, obtain gears, gain buffs, and so on, where clearing a room will unlock adjacent rooms.
                <br>
                Should the player reach the pre-boss room, they can initiate a final boss fight.
